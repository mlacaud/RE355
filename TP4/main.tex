\section{Introduction - Setup}

This lab session deals with the use of Docker Swarm and additional tools to discover the issues with file sharing and elasticity in distributed systems. 
As it is the final lab session, you are supposed to know the basics.
We will expect you to search and find information by yourselves in the official documentations.
For this session, you need to work in groups with 3 to 4 computers on the same local network.

First of all, reinitialize each computer:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,language={sh}]  % Start your code-block

$ razrezo

$ date --set "$(curl https://time.akamai.com/?iso)"

$ docker service restart 

\end{lstlisting}

Be sure that chromium is installed in at least one of your computers: 

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,language={sh}]  % Start your code-block

$ apt install chromium
	
\end{lstlisting}

You can start chromium as root in a terminal by using: 

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,language={sh}]  % Start your code-block

$ chromium --no-sandbox &
		
\end{lstlisting}

Then, create your swarm with: 

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,language={sh}]  % Start your code-block

$ docker swarm init

\end{lstlisting}

and join the swarm with all the machines.

Download the correction of the 2nd lab session from Moodle and extract it. 
Go into the extracted folder and start the application:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,language={sh}]  % Start your code-block

$ docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml {stack-name}

\end{lstlisting}

After a few seconds, you should be able to see your running application at the address \textbf{http://127.0.0.1:3000/} in chromium:

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single,language={sh}]  % Start your code-block

$ chromium --no-sandbox http://127.0.0.1:3000/ &
		
\end{lstlisting}

\section{File systems in the application}

Two application modules (inside containers) are storing informations on their local file system. 
The \textbf{Server} is storing the raw video waiting to be encoded, and the encoded video to be served, in its folder \textit{/go/app/fileServers}. 
The \textbf{Storage} (i.e. the database) is storing data in its folder \textit{/var/lib/mysql}.

\section{The problem with volumes...}

This section introduces the problem of volumes in Docker.

\subsection{Safe replication}

\begin{questions}
	\question Using \textbf{docker service}, create 3 replicas of the frontend.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Refresh the web page several times. Do you see any change in the page? Does the application still work from different Frontend containers?
		\item Why is the replication of the Frontend working?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{questions}

\subsection{Critical replication}

\begin{questions}
	\question Using \textbf{docker service}, create 3 replicas of the server.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Refresh the web page several times. Is the application still working every time?
		\item Knowing that the video data are stored on the file system of the server, what is happening?
		\item Docker Swarm does not include any tool to create distributed volumes. Do you know any tool to create distributed file systems?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{questions}

\subsection{Persistence in the database}

\begin{questions}
	\question Using \textbf{docker service}, create 3 replicas of the database.
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Refresh the web page several times. Is the application still working every time?
		\item Why?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{questions}
